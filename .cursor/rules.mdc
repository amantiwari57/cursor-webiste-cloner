# Shadcn UI MCP Component Rules

1. When building UIs, always **search the shadcn MCP registries before creating custom components**.
2. If a component exists in any connected registry, **use and import that component directly.**
3. For best results, **prefer adding components via the MCP server or by direct registry URL (using `npx shadcn@latest add <json-url>`) when available**.
4. Respect the recommended file paths and imports as specified by the registry.
5. Always resolve and install any listed dependencies after importing a registry component.
6. *Never re-invent* standard UI blocksâ€”always favor official shadcn, Aceternity, or Magic UI components whenever possible.
7. **Document** any manual changes to MCP components in your local README.
8. Run automated accessibility, responsive, and regression tests after installation.
9. If cloning a website open using playwright and make sure to match the ui and responsiveness
